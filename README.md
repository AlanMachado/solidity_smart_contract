# Solidity Smart Contracts

With Solidity you can develop and put your contracts in a blockchain network to see more visit [https://solidity.readthedocs.io]

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the (Node.jsÂ® web site)[https://nodejs.org/en/].

### Configuring your project

After installing node and npm you can simply run npm install inside smart_contracts folder, to install all dependencies 

or 

- Install openzeppelin-solidity with --save flag to save dependency to our package.json file
```
npm install openzeppelin-solidity --save
```

- Install truffle-hdwallet-provider with --save flag to save dependency to our package.json file
```
npm install truffle-hdwallet-provider --save
```

you will also need 

- Install http-server, to start a server and access the index.html.
```
npm install http-server -g
```

### Initializing Project

``` 
execute http-server 
```
To claim a star you will need to inform. They must be unique.

- Name is the name for the Star
- RA stands for Right Ascension
- DEC is the abbreviation for Declination
- Mag stands for Magnitude
- Cen stands for Centaurus, but we are using to represent the constellation 
- Story is the story of the Star

The feedback of the transaction, for now, it's wallet's responsibility.

### Hash transaction Examples
